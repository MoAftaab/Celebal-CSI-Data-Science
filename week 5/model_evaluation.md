# Model Selection and Evaluation for House Price Prediction

## Introduction
Selecting the appropriate regression model is crucial for accurate house price predictions. This document outlines the methodology for model selection, evaluation metrics, and the advantages and limitations of different regression techniques used in this project.

## Regression Models Implemented

### 1. Linear Regression
**Principles:** Establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

**Advantages:**
- Simplicity and interpretability
- Computational efficiency
- Baseline for comparing more complex models

**Limitations:**
- Assumes linear relationships between features and target
- Sensitive to outliers
- Struggles with high-dimensional data (multicollinearity issues)

### 2. Regularized Linear Models

#### a) Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
**Principles:** Adds a penalty term proportional to the square of coefficient magnitudes, shrinking them towards zero but rarely to exactly zero.

**Advantages:**
- Handles multicollinearity by shrinking correlated features together
- More stable than ordinary least squares
- Suitable when most features are relevant

**Limitations:**
- Still keeps all features in the model
- Less interpretable than simple linear regression
- Requires tuning of regularization parameter (alpha)

#### b) Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
**Principles:** Adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero.

**Advantages:**
- Performs feature selection implicitly
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Produces sparse models

**Limitations:**
- May be unstable with correlated features
- Requires tuning of regularization parameter
- Can be too aggressive in feature elimination

#### c) Elastic Net
**Principles:** Combines L1 and L2 penalties to balance between Lasso and Ridge regression properties.

**Advantages:**
- Handles correlated features better than Lasso
- Retains feature selection capabilities
- More robust than either Ridge or Lasso alone

**Limitations:**
- Requires tuning of two parameters
- Added complexity in implementation and interpretation
- Computational overhead compared to simpler models

### 3. Tree-Based Models

#### a) Random Forest
**Principles:** Ensemble of decision trees trained on different bootstrap samples using random feature subset selection.

**Advantages:**
- Handles non-linear relationships automatically
- Robust to outliers and missing values
- Provides feature importance measures
- Reduces overfitting through averaging

**Limitations:**
- Less interpretable than linear models
- Computationally intensive
- May overfit if trees are too deep

#### b) Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
**Principles:** Sequentially builds weak learners (trees) that correct errors of previous models through gradient descent.

**Advantages:**
- Often achieves superior performance
- Handles mixed data types well
- Flexible in capturing complex patterns

**Limitations:**
- Prone to overfitting without careful tuning
- Computationally intensive
- Less interpretable than simpler models

#### c) XGBoost
**Principles:** Optimized implementation of gradient boosting with additional regularization and parallel processing capabilities.

**Advantages:**
- Generally superior performance
- Built-in cross-validation
- Regularization features to prevent overfitting
- Efficient handling of sparse data

**Limitations:**
- Requires careful parameter tuning
- Black-box nature reduces interpretability
- Can be computationally expensive for large datasets

#### d) LightGBM
**Principles:** Gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms with optimizations for speed and memory efficiency.

**Advantages:**
- Faster training speed than XGBoost
- Lower memory usage
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Support for categorical features

**Limitations:**
- May overfit on small datasets
- Requires careful parameter tuning
- Less interpretable than simpler models

## Evaluation Methodology

### Metrics

#### 1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- **Formula:** $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$
- **Interpretation:** Average deviation of predictions from actual values, with larger errors penalized more heavily
- **Advantages:** Same unit as target variable, sensitive to outliers

#### 2. Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- **Formula:** $1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$
- **Interpretation:** Proportion of variance in target variable explained by the model
- **Advantages:** Scale-free measure between 0 and 1, easier to interpret across problems

### Validation Strategy

#### K-Fold Cross-Validation
- **Implementation:** 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance evaluation
- **Advantages:** Provides more reliable performance estimates by using all data for both training and validation
- **Application:** Used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection

#### Train-Test Split
- **Implementation:** 80-20 split for final model evaluation
- **Advantages:** Simulates real-world application where model predicts on unseen data
- **Application:** Used for final performance assessment and comparison

## Model Selection Criteria

1. **Predictive Performance:** Primary criterion based on lowest validation RMSE
2. **Generalization Ability:** Models that maintain similar performance between training and validation sets
3. **Interpretability:** Consideration of feature importance and model transparency
4. **Complexity vs. Performance Tradeoff:** Preference for simpler models when performance differences are marginal

## Final Model Selection

Based on comprehensive evaluation, the final model was selected by:
1. Identifying models with lowest RMSE on validation data
2. Checking for overfitting by comparing training and validation errors
3. Evaluating real-world applicability and interpretability

In the house price prediction context, ensemble methods (particularly XGBoost) often achieved the best predictive performance, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.
