### Data Files

1. **data/train.csv**
   - Training dataset with 1,460 observations
   - Contains all features and the target variable (SalePrice)

2. **data/test.csv**
   - Test dataset with 1,459 observations
   - Contains all features except the target variable

3. **data/data_description.txt**
   - Detailed descriptions of all 79 features
   - Information about measurement units and possible values

4. **data/sample_submission.csv**

   - Generated during script execution
   - Include exploratory plots, model comparison charts, and feature importance visualizations

2. **submission.csv**
   - Generated after running the prediction script
   - Contains predicted house prices for the test dataset

## Development Workflow

1. Start by reading the README.md to understand the project
2. Review data_description.txt to understand the features
3. Install required packages from requirements.txt
4. Run house_price_prediction.py to execute the entire pipeline
5. Check the visualizations folder for insights
6. Review documentation files for detailed methodology

## Design Philosophy

The project follows a modular and object-oriented design:
- Separating concerns into distinct methods within the HousePricePredictor class
- Making each component (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, etc.) independent and reusable
- Comprehensive documentation to explain both technical implementation and theoretical concepts
- Emphasis on reproducibility and clarity
